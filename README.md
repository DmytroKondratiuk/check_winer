The customer is a bookmaker. The goal is to write a code that accepts the result - “1:1” and the bet “0:0” and returns the result as follows: 1 - the client guessed the result, 0 - guessed the outcome, -1 - did not guess. If the input data is incorrect (for example, the lines are not in the format "X:Y", contain letters, negative numbers or other errors), the code should return an error with a clear message.
